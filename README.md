# sharp01

Sharp01 is a simple, sharp Tumblr theme.

# features

* Good code. I’ve read your theme’s code. I don’t like it; from completely
  useless Javascript to awful, copy-pasted CSS they’re not good.
* Photosets that work. This is surprisingly difficult; by default, the
  `{Photoset` directive doesn't work at all; on phones, it’ll load a photoset
  waaaay too wide, fucking up the whole theme. I had to reassemble the photoset
  manually in Javascript, which is a shame but there was no other way. It’s
  about 100 LOC which isn’t too bad, all things considered.
* High customizability; there’s about a billion options and ways to customize
  the theme’s text and look, from post borders to background gradients.

# what’s it look like
